CREATIONAL PATTERN


  1. Singleton
  
    a.	Control the access and instantiate only 1x
    b.	Reduce the memory utilization
    c.	Static structures are more flexible 
    
    
  2.	FactoryMethod
  
    a.	Also known as Virtual Constructor
    b.	Create realtime object factories and let the object decides the type dynamically
    c.	The Factory Method has an interface that creates the object but the subclasses will decide which class will be instantiated
